I'm an Italian guy that has always had a passion for finding out the inner workings of things, especially computers.

At the age of 19, after finishing my school career, I decided to follow my passion related to computers and their inner workings.

I chose to start a post-graduation journey in software development at (ITS Alto Adriatico)[https://www.itsaltoadriatico.it/] with the IoT development curriculum.

As for now, as a fresh graduate, my future goals are:

- Unveil the inner workings of the backend engineering sector and focus on building reliable, scalable, and maintainable software.

- Contribute to open source initiatives in order to progress in the field of software engineering and deepen my grasp of the inner workings and choices of well-known software.
